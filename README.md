# cs130
This repo includes my team's code for cs130 at UCLA. The project was about giving merchant executives the best visualization for data about their client, in order to see where the store needs improvement.  

To run the back end:
```
cd backend/merchant-insights/
npm install
npm run
```
  
Then, to run the front end:
```
cd frontend/merchant-insight-react/
npm install
npm run
```
